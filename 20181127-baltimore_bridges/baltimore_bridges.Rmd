Analyzing data for #tidytuesday week of 11/20/2018

source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018-11-27

```{r}
# load packages and parse data
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(forcats)
library(ggmap)

bridges_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018-11-27/baltimore_bridges.csv")

bridges <- bridges_raw
```


### Older bridges typically receive less traffic over time
```{r}
# manually reorder bridge_condition factors
x <- bridges
x$bridge_condition <- as.factor(x$bridge_condition)
x$bridge_condition <- factor(x$bridge_condition, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good"))

x %>%  
  filter(yr_built >= 1900) %>% # removing 2017 due to outlier
  select(lat, long, yr_built, bridge_condition, avg_daily_traffic) %>%
  group_by(yr_built, bridge_condition) %>%
  summarize(avg_daily_traffic = mean(avg_daily_traffic)) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(yr_built, avg_daily_traffic, fill = bridge_condition),
           alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = comma_format(), 
                     limits = c(0, 223000)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1') +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Set1') +
  geom_smooth(aes(yr_built, avg_daily_traffic, 
                  color = bridge_condition),
              se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
  labs(x = "",
        y = "",
        title = "Baltimore bridges: average daily traffic over time",
       subtitle = "Applied smoothing to highlight differences in bridge conditions and dampen outliers",
       fill = "Bridge Condition",
       color = "Bridge Condition") 

```

### How much does it cost to maintain the bridge per car?
```{r}
# replace NA with 0
bridges$total_improve_cost_thousands[is.na(bridges$total_improve_cost_thousands)] <- 0

bridges %>% 
  filter(yr_built >= 1900) %>%
  select(lat, long, yr_built, bridge_condition, avg_daily_traffic, total_improve_cost_thousands) %>%
  mutate(cost_car_improve = total_improve_cost_thousands / avg_daily_traffic) %>% 
  group_by(yr_built, bridge_condition) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(yr_built, cost_car_improve, fill = bridge_condition)) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar_format()) + 
  facet_grid(bridge_condition ~ .) + 
  theme_bw()

```

### Does the data record bridge_condition change over time for any given bridge?
```{r}
bridges %>%
  select(carries, avg_daily_traffic, total_improve_cost_thousands, bridge_condition) %>%
  group_by(bridge_condition) %>%
  #mutate(total_improve_cost_thousands = (total_improve_cost_thousands)) %>% 
  summarize(avg_daily_traffic = mean(avg_daily_traffic),
            total_improve_cost_thousands = sum(total_improve_cost_thousands), 
            cost_per_vehicle = total_improve_cost_thousands / avg_daily_traffic) %>% View()
```

### Validating lat/long data to fit Baltimore map
```{r}
# note to self: coordinates from file not matching ggmap so come back to this at a later time

baltimore <- as_tibble(map_data("county", regions = "maryland,baltimore"))

bridges %>%
  full_join(baltimore) %>%
  group_by(lat, long) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(long, lat)) +
  geom_polygon(data = baltimore, aes(long, lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = 'black')

```
